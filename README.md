# Abit

A Bitmessage client for Android.

**Please be aware that at the current state, it most probably will suck your
battery dry and use up your data plan within hours. Use at your own peril.**

It uses the [Jabit Bitmessage library](https://github.com/Dissem/Jabit). (I
know, the names are getting increasingly ridiculus. I fear it might turn into
a Habit.)
