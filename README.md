# Abit

A Bitmessage client for Android.

**Please be aware that due to the protocol, sending messages might suck your
battery dry. Also, it causes a lot of traffic and may use up your data plan
rather quickly. Use at your own peril.**

Abit uses the [Jabit Bitmessage library](https://github.com/Dissem/Jabit).

## Requirements
You'll need at least Android 4.4 KitKat. Due to the Proof of Work that comes
with the protocol you might want as fast a processor and as many cores as
you can get.
