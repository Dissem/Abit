Like any respectable Bitmessage client, Abit doesn't store anything on its servers apart
from the usual Bitmessage stuff (see below). The camera permission is only used to scan
QR codes so you can easily share Bitmessage addresses.

# The Usual Bitmessage Stuff
Bitmessage sends your encrypted messages to all participants. As we maintain our own server
to help the network, of course we'll get all your messages, too. But

1. we don't know they're from you
2. they're among all the other messages from all the other Bitmessage users
3. we can't read them as they're encrypted

We'll happily give all this useless data to any authorities who either provide a search
order from a swiss court or are asking really nicely.
